# Test Cases in CMU-HTTP

We provide four sample websites in Checkpoint 1.
You're encouraged to test with other websites.
Just **save** the web page when you surfing the Internet with your browser, and put the whole directory here, you will be able to see your own website.

In this directory, `test_visual` is the simplest and smallest website.
For the other three, `test_single` is a huge HTML page, `test_multiple` is a bunch of small independent files, and `test_dependency` is a website where files have dependency between each other.
The `dependency.csv` in each directory describes all the files in that directory, and whether and which file loading a certain file depends.
